# Lab 33 - Pig

This is for a **major grade**.  

### Introduction

The game of Pig is a game played by 2 or more people with one six sided die.  You will be implementing this game with a GUI.  All the images you need have been provided for you.

### Rules of Pig

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)):

> Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

> * If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
> * If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
> * If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
> * The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

>For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.

### Requirements

You will be creating a GUI that allows two people to play Pig.  Here are some things that your GUI should use/do.

* Display `roll.gif` to start the game.
* Display `hold.gif` when the player decides to hold.
* Have 2 buttons; one to roll, one to hold.
* Display an image of the die face that was rolled.
* Display each player's score, the current turn's score, and indicate who's turn it is.
* Your GUI elements cannot be entirely in a single row or column.
* Use at least one each of `Frame`, `Label`, and `Button`.

**All of the code you submit must be your own.  You may use the internet for looking up commands or syntax, but you should not be using code that is not yours.**

## Due Date and Time

This is due March 9th at 11:59 pm.  **I will grade the last commit that occurs before March 9th at 11:59 pm.**  You will have all of classtime until the due date to work and ask questions.  You have 1 week to work on this; being absent doesn't give you extra time.  If you encounter extreme circumstances, then you must communicate with me.
